# Handling-Imbalance-Dataset
A model has been trained on an imbalanced dataset.
To tackle the imbalanced dataset different techniques have been used: Repetition Technique, SMOTE and modified SMOTE.
They are compared through various performance parameters which are calculated for each technique.
Modified SMOTE is found to be the best one.
